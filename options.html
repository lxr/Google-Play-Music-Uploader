		Use of this extension requires authorizing it with your
		Google Account. This requires obtaining an authorization
		code from a special Google authorization page where you
		grant the extension access to your Google Play Music
		library. Once the code has been provided, saving the
		extension settings exchanges it for the proper access
		and refresh tokens, finalizing the authorization
		process. If installed on multiple browsers, this must
		be done once for each.

		The device ID is a string by which the Google servers
		identify a Google Play Music client. (This is distinct
		from the device name, which is listed on the Google Play
		Music Settings page.) If you have Google Play Music
		Uploader installed on several browsers, use the same
		ID for each, so as not to pointlessly use up your
		account's device quota. The string can be anything
		reasonably unique on Google's side; for example, your
		Google Account's e-mail address.
